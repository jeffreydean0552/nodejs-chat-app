# Node.js Chat App

A simple demo chat app built on Node.js, Express and Socket.io

## Installation

To setup the project for local development / testing, you will need to install Node.js and NPM. I don't explicitly specify a minimum Node.js/NPM version for the app but I recommend going with whatever the latest LTS version is at the point in time you are setting things up. The current Node.js LTS version is **10.16.3**.
